# Hilo
HiLo (also known as High Low) is a game where the player draws a card and then has to guess if the next card they're gonna draw will have a higher or lower number than the one drawn previously. The player will start out with 300 points. If they guess correctly, they will earn 100 more points. If they don't guess correctly, they'll lose 75 points. If the player reaches 0 points, it's game over. 
The player will be asked each round if they want to play another round. If they say yes, the game will keep going. If they say no, then the game will end with their current score.
